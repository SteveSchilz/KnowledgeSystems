# Public Obsidian Vaults
These vaults provide other examples of what can be done. 
I have divided them into "Source Repositories" and "HTML Uploads", because the latter is less functional, and are also less valuable as a means of learning to create these vaults
## Source Repositories 
These are Git Repositories of Public Obsidian Vaults that you can download, clone or possibly contribute to. 

* [GitHub-SteveSchilz-KnowledgeSystems](https://github.com/SteveSchilz/KnowledgeSystems) (This Vault)! 

## HTML Uploads 
These are web pages representing snapshots of other peoples Obsidian Vaults 

 * [Aidan Helfant-Digital Garden](https://publish.obsidian.md/aidanhelfant/%F0%9F%8F%A0+My+Home) Obsidian Upload by PMK Expert [[Author-Aiden Heifant]]
