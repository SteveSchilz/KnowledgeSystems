Synopsis:  Understanding the folders, tags, and conventions in this Zettelkasten system 
Tags: #Zettelkasten 
 
# Introduction 
ZettelKasten is German for "slip box", or a box of index card file, like they used to use in libraries.  In the 20th century (1900s), such systems were based on 3x5 cards. Each card is called an "Atomic Note" or Zettel.   Each note is cross-referenced to source material and other notes.  Due to this linking, this system is often cited as a precursor to HTML hyperlinks.

This system derives value largely because the cross-referencing allows connections  between ideas to become apparent over time.   This allows for original ideas to arise and be clearly expressed, and source material properly referenced.

The Obsidian software has "tag cloud" visualizaion, and powerful tools to manage links between documents automatically. 

References to the original source material. 

A prominent user of the ZettelKasten system was [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann), a German Sociologist that died in 1998.  This system allowed him to produce 40 books and over 400 peer reviewed papers in his lifetime. 

## Atomic Note (Zettel)
The main kind of note file, an Atomic Note or "Zettel" contains a single idea, expressed in your own words, along with links to other related ideas, and links to reference material

## ZettelKasten Folders 
In Obsidian, click the "Folder" icon at the upper left in the title bar to view the folder structure. 

The system implemented here uses folders as follows

* **Atomic Notes**  - The main Notes folder.  
* **Files**:                - Images, drawings: all files that are not native Markdown Text.
* **Readmes**         - How to guides for getting started.
* **References:**     - Notes about source material:  Authors, Videos, Books. 
* **Journal:             - Daily work notes (WIP, not mature)
* **Templates:**      - Used to generate new Notes of various types.
