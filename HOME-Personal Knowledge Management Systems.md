# Introduction
Personal knowledge management systems are systems to organize your digital notes for authors, researchers, and content creators.  These systems, particularly Zettelkasten foster creation of new original ideas, and help the author to clearly express these ideas with references to the original content. 

This vault uses two primary systems, the Zettelkasten Method, and the CODE note acquisition system.

## Zettel Kasten - (Card Slips)
This is the primary knowledge system used in this Obsidian Vault.  It uses hyperlinks, original document references, and tags in order to allow knowledge to be discovered organically
