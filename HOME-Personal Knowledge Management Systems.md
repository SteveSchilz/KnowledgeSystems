Synopsis:  THE Home Page.

See [[Readme-Installation]] to get started with the Obsidian Software to use this system.
# Introduction
Personal knowledge management systems are systems to organize your digital notes for authors, researchers, and content creators.  These systems, particularly Zettelkasten, foster creation of new original ideas, and help the author to clearly express their original ideas with references to the original content. 

This vault uses two primary systems, the Zettelkasten Method, and the CODE note acquisition system. 

# I. Knowledge Management Systems 
---
## Zettel Kasten (Note Filing and Cross-Referencing Process)
This is the primary knowledge system used in this Obsidian Vault.  It uses hyperlinks, original document references, and tags in order to allow knowledge to be discovered organically
 
See : [[ZettelKastenSystem]] -

## Code (General Note Organizing Process)
Code is a series of four steps in the note taking process 

* **Collect** - Collect everything, take massive notes	
 * **Organize** - Organize the notes into zettel (standalone ideas in your own words)
 *  **Distill** - Create Maps of Content (link together your notes, put your own spin on it.)
 * **Express** - Generate your content (books, essays, Youtube Videos, talks, etc.)

## PARA (Folder Organization System)
PARA attempts to organize your data in to four Categories from most often accessed to least often. 
It was developed by Tiago. I haven't used it much.
