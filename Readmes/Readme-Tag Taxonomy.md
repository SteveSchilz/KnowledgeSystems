Synopsis:  Reference for understanding the  tag system.

# Introduction

# Introduction
Tags (along with crosslinks) are one of the central ways of relating ideas to each other. 
A tag is the same as a twitter hashtag, e.g. a hash character followed by one or more words, no spaces.   They are used to group related Ideas

Obsidian has amazing tools for easily visualizing, sorting and editing tags.
For example, clicking on an individual tag will show a list of all references to that tag. 
You can use this to review and consolidate your tags.  

There is also visual tag map (below the search icon in the left icon bar), You can see all tag references, or  a local tag map related to links within a certain distance from the current note.    As your system grows, understanding the local tag map will be important. 

You probably don't want a million tags in your system.

# TODO: Local Tag Map
Understand how to display the local tag map, mentioned in [[Video-Aidan Helfant-Watch this to finally understand the Zettelkasten Method in Obsidian]]
