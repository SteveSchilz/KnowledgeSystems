## Things to learn about  Obsidian 

1. You have to understand Markdown, start with he official [Obsidian Markdown Reference](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax)
2. Learn how to use [Tabs in Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/User+interface/Use+tabs+in+Obsidian)
3. Creating Notes: 
	1. ctrl-n = create new note 
	2. ctrl+o = open -> Helps to find related notes

## Things that confused me:

I often expect Markdown Viewers to work like Word or Google Docs.  Markdown is not quite that capable.   These are things where I commonly am not able to accomplish exactly what I am setting out to do. 

* **Multi-Level Lists** In general, [Multi-level Lists](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-create-lists-obsidian/) in markdown are pretty easy, however in Obsidian, it is not easy to create second-level lists with a., b., c. .. Instead, use bullet points for second level lists as recommended in this [Obsidian feature request](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/multi-level-lists-and-alphabetic-lists/3889)
  
* **Indenting Text:**  Creating things like a list with titles and a paragraph indent is not easy in Markdown.  Major flaw, IMO.   However, the web shares this characteristic. 
  
# Obsidian Markdown Notes

* **Separating Tags from Headers** : Headers have a space after the hasthag, Tags do not.
   
* Link to internal anchor (heading in note):   See [Obsidian: internal Links](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links) .  
	*  Syntax:  [ [ Note Heading # internal anchor name] ]
	*  Example [[Readme-Using Obsidian#Things to learn about Obsidian]] 
	  
* **Images**.  To display an image use one of 
	* Obsidian Style    ! [ [ image-file-name ] |100x150]  (Works only in obsidian)
	* Relative file path:  :\[Title\]\\(../../image-file-name.png)
