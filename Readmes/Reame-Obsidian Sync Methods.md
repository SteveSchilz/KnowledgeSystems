# Obsidian Sync Methods

Obsidian can be synced to the. web in three ways

1. Using GitHub. (Useful for a public vault, with collaborators)
2. Using paid Obsidian Sync
3. Using a sync'ed folder, e.g. DropBox or GoogleDrive.

## Github
By placing your obsidian vault in a Git repository, it can be shared as with any Git project.
**Advantages**
* Controlled access by multiple people
* Conscious decision to push up changes 
**Disadvantages**
* Need Git Hub account*
* Git Learning Cuve

* ## Google Drive
Google Drive bypasses the pain of git and allows multiple people to see or edit the files, but there are some disadvantages:

**Advantages**
* Simpler than git


**Disadvantages**
* you need Google Desktop, with folder sync
* Access is not controlled, anyone changes a text file, and the change will be automatically replicated.

**Setup**
Setting this up was moderately complicated:
	1. Download Google Drive, Set it up to sync the folder
	2. My friend shared a Google Drive folder
	3. I was able to create a symbolic link to my Google Drive folder, and pop that into the shared folder. 
	   To symlink a document located in one Google Drive folder, in a different Google Drive folder, select the document you want to symlink, then hit Shift+Z and you'll be presented with a menu to choose the folder you'd like to add a symlink to [https://www.labnol.org/internet/add-files-multiple-drive-folders/28715/](https://www.labnol.org/internet/add-files-multiple-drive-folders/28715/)
