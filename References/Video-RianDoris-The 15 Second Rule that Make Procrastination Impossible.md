# References

0:00 Three types

3:00 Tension - Appraoach/Avoidance 
   *  Getting close to the  task increases avoidance

* Athletes use flow state to make more progress

**Phases of Struggle**
* **Engage:** Entering Struggle Making the decision to start 
* **Struggle** 
* **Release** 
* **Flow**

6:00 Engage is the big problem. 
 (Mihaly Czik...) - Studied Flow found that people experienced flow, used  flow triggers

**Flow Triggers**
1.  **Set Clear, Specific, Immediate Goals:** Use specific, Immediate goals (make soccer goal) vs further off (win the match)
2. **Break Project into small tasks** - Creates wins -> Dopamine. 
3. **Reduce Effort to Start** actions should be small, easy. - Goal is to reduce effort to get started. 
4. **Use Time to your advantage.**. For example, setting a short deadline to finish something may inspire you
5. **Define The Scope:**. If scope is ambiguous, may not start because it could take a long time.   Spend a few minutes to define next bite size chunk
6. **Bypassing Response Inhibition**:  Eg, jump in quickly to cold water without thinking about it. - More time you spend thinking about it - the harder it is. 

16:00 **Sleep to Flow Strategy**
* Delta waves (sleep) close to Alpha Waves (Flow) -> Theta Waves -> Make Connections.
* Be prepared to start work immediately after waking up
* Work on the highly important, low urgency 

17:20 **Flow Payoff**
* Flow has lots of rewards
* Work has lots of rewards.

* **Schedule Organization:**  Lots of meetings led to schedule with no time for flow state.
	* That schedule makes it hard to get to flow, because you have to overcome the struggle phase, and you know you are likely to be interrupted too soon to make this worthwhile
	* Crossing between tasks breaks flow. 

 20:30 **Don't Confuse Ambivalence with Procrastination**
 * **Procrastination:**  Desire to things you should do
 * **Ambivalence:**   Nagging feeling that you shouldn't be doing something.
