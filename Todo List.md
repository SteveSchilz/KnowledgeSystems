- [ ] Figure out standard format templates
	-Have some good progress here, see these: 
	- Atomic Note 
	- Author 
	- Book
	- Quote 

- [ ] Determine how to edit an Obsidian Tag
	- Tap on a tag anywhere to show all references to a tag
	- Can visit and edit
	- Works ok if not too many references
	- Global Search and Replace for tags? 

- [ ] Settle on an Image sizing Link Format
	- Markdown image sizing has various flavors, easiest one is Obsidian Specific :(
