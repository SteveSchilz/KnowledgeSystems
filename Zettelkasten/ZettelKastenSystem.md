# The Zettelkasten System

ZettelKasten is German for "slip box", or a box of index card file, like they used to use in libraries.  In the 20th century (1900s), such systems were based on 3x5 cards.   This system is often cited as a precursor to HTML hyperlinks.

This system derives value largely by  cross-referencing notes, and also providing good references to the original source material.  Good references are important for scholars and authors.

A prominent user of the ZettelKasten system was [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann), a German Sociologist that died in 1998.  This system allowed him to produce 40 books and over 400 peer reviewed papers in his lifetime.
